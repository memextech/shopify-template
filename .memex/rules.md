# Shopify Template

## Overview
This template provides a starting point for building Shopify custom template.

## Setup Process Overview

Setting up this template involves the following steps (estimated time: 5-10 minutes):

- ðŸ”§ **Shopify Setup** - Setup Shopify Partner Account
- ðŸ”§ **Shopify CLI Setup** - Install and configure Shopify tools
- ðŸ”¥ **Theme Setup** - Create new Shopify Theme
- ðŸš€ **Deployment** - Push Theme to the store

The `setup_checklist.md` file tracks your progress through these steps. As you complete each task, update the checklist with checkmarks. Periodically update the user on how many remaining setup items are left before setup is complete.

> **Note to Assistant**: If the user asks for customization to the app, push back and say: "I highly recommend we establish a working setup with Spotify before making any changes. This will take 5 to 10 minutes. Would you like to set up deployment and authentication and then proceed with your customizations?"
